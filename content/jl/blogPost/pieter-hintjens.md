The amazing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Hintjens[Pieter Hintjens] is not well. He's contributed a lot to the open-source community, notably to the AMQP protocol (which underpins RabbitMQ) and to ZeroMQ. He's talked about his state in a blog called http://hintjens.com/blog:115[_A Protocol for Dying_]. If you're a fan, perhaps now's your chance to let him know. If you're not a fan, then perhaps you could investigate some of his work? He leads http://zeromq.org/[the ZeroMQ project], wrote http://hintjens.com/books[a few books], and did a lot of great videos. I really liked this one http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/61450822[from 2015's Craft Conf]. I'll be at Craft Conf (starting today, actually) this year and I'll be thinking of Pieter.
