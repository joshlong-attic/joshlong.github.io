I was just discharged  from the  United Christian Hospital (a public hospital) in Hong Kong after an overnight stay there. It started at a YOW! Hong Kong speaker dinner on Friday. The show was amazing, as you'd expect from any _YOW!_ event, and I was particularly looking forward to the speaker's dinner with so many of my heroes and friends.

We arrived and slowly the food started appearing and I attacked it with my usual glee. First, the appetizers arrived. Lots of good choices and I tried them all. I particularly enjoyed the mushrooms and scallops. I ate a plate, and another besides. Dinner table conversation was, as you can imagine, world-class.  I was sat next to Dr. Sengupta and Joe Ambari. I turned to Joe and shared that my hands and feet were starting to itch. I'd felt such an itch on my hands before and didn't think much of it. Maybe I'd used an overly abrasive soap? Here,  both my feet and my hands were suddenly burning! I even took my shoes off to rub my feet (in the socks i was wearing) on the carpet.

I was OK for ten to fifteen minutes. I started feeling short of breath. But I'm used to feeling short of breath - I'm asthmatic! I don't leap to conclusions. If I have gas, I might be short of breath. I might pant from physical exertion. I might be short of breath. And besides, I always keep an emergency Albuterol rescue inhaler in my pockets. I never use it, though. My asthma is well managed thanks to daily intake of Dulera, a preventative medecine. The emergency inhaler was just that: for _emergencies_. So I took a few puffs. Nothing. The shortness of breath was getting worse. I raised the issue with Dave Thomas, the founder of the YOW! conference and a friend, and he had Cantonse- and Chinese-speaking aid Marlous quickly get me some medical help.

We walked to the front of the restaurant. The ambulance was on its way. By this point I was super short of breath and my heart was pounding. I was struggling to take in oxygen so my heart was pumping harder. My extremities were tingling. I was dizzy. I was sitting there gasping for air, trying to answer whatever questions I could to make sure Marlous had enough context to talk to the medics when they arrived. Even if they spoke English, who's to say I would still be conscious?

I was terrified. I hadn't faced such an uphill asthma attack since I was a little boy. No matter what I did the airways closed. Apparently an antihistamine like Benadryl and an epinephrin pen would've been _really_ handy then and there but I had left them in my backpack in the hotel.
