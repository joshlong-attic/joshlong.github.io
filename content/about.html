People in the community have given me my name, in their culture. I love this very much. Thank you for any additions!

* **Chinese**: 龍之春  (it means "Spring Dragon", as my last name "Long" means "Dragon" in Chinese)
* **Japanese**: 龙之春
* **Hindi**:  जोश  (it means "passion", and sounds _almost_ like "Joosh"!)
* **Kannada/Kanarese**: ಜೆಪ
