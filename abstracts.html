	<p><p>All talks are workable in a one-hour slot  unless otherwise noted.</p>
<h2>Kubernetes Native Java</h2>
<p>Spring is all about helping developers get to production quickly and safely. These days, &quot;production&quot; is all but guaranteed to mean Kubernetes, and Spring has you covered. Join me, Spring Developer Advocate <a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman">Josh Long (@starbuxman)</a>, and we'll look at how Spring Boot makes writing blisteringly fast, cloud-native, and scalable services more effortless than ever.</p>
<h2>The RSocket Revolution</h2>
<p><a href="http://RSocket.io">RSocket is here!</a> RSocket is a binary, reactive, and operations-friendly wire protocol that integrates that builds on top of Project Reactor. Engineers originally developed RSocket at Netflix. Then they moved to Facebook. RSocket was the fledgling project for the Reactive Foundation, of which the spring team, Lightbend, Facebook, Alibaba, and others are founding members. RSocket represents the operational insight of some of the largest organizations in the world. And, it readily integrates with Spring. Join me, Spring Developer Advocate <a href="http://twitter.com/starbuxman">Josh Long (@starbuxman)</a> in this rapid, reactive ride on the RSocket rocket, and we'll look at the rich Spring support for RSocket and its use in building faster, more robust and more scalable services.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to build RSocket-based controllers in Spring Framework</li>
<li>Build RSocket clients using the <code>RSocketRequester</code></li>
<li>How to use the <code>rsc</code> client</li>
<li>Build processing pipelines using Spring Integration</li>
<li>Secure our services with Spring Security</li>
<li>Introduce bidirectional communication</li>
<li>and more!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reactive Spring</h2>
<p>Microservices and big-data increasingly confront us with the  limitations of traditional input/output. In traditional IO, work that is IO-bound dominates   threads. This wouldn't be such a big deal if we could add more threads cheaply, but threads are expensive on the JVM, and most other platforms. Even if threads were cheap and infinitely scalable, we'd still be confronted with the faulty nature of networks. Things break, and they often do so in subtle, but non-exceptional ways. Traditional approaches to integration bury the faulty nature of networks behind overly simplifying abstractions. We need something better.</p>
<p>Spring Framework 5 is here! It introduces the Spring developer to a growing world of support for reactive programming across the Spring portfolio, starting with a new Netty-based web runtime, component model and module called Spring WebFlux, and then continuing to Spring Data Kay, Spring Security 5.0, Spring Boot 2.0 and Spring Cloud Finchley. Sure, it sounds like a lot, but don't worry! Join me, your guide, Spring developer advocate Josh Long, and we'll explore the wacky, wonderful world of Reactive Spring together.</p>
<h2>Bootiful Testing (1-3h)</h2>
<p>How would you feel if you knew that any pat of the code was at most a few minutes away from being shippable and delivered into production?  How would you feel if you knew that any part of the code is a few ctrl+z's away from being shippable and delivered into production? Emboldened and confident? Test driven development (TDD) gives you that. TDD allows you to proceed with confidence that you're building the right thing. It provides you with imminent-horizons that you can meet and measure. TDD gives developers the confidence to go faster, secure in the knowledge that what they break they will fix and be able to improve. In this talk, join Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman) as he looks at how to test Spring applications and services. We'll look at how to test basic components, mocks, how to take advantage of test slices, and how to test web applications. We'll also  look at how to  ensure that  API producers and API consumers work well together using consumer driven contract testing (CDCT) without sacrificing the testing pyramid for  end-to-end integration tests.</p>
<h2>Bootiful Kotlin</h2>
<p>Spring Boot, the convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development on the JVM not just fly, but pleasant! Spring Boot aims to make address the common functional and non-functional requirements that gate quickly moving to production. The framework is as clean as it gets, wouldn't it be nice if the language matched its elegance?</p>
<p>Kotlin, the productivity-focused language from our friends at JetBrains, takes up the slack to make the experience leaner, cleaner and even more pleasant!</p>
<p>The Spring and Kotlin teams have worked hard to make sure that Kotlin and Spring Boot are a first-class experience for all developers trying to get to production, faster and safer. Come for the Spring and stay for the Bootiful Kotlin.</p>
<h2>Cloud Native Java (3-6h)</h2>
<p>“It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.” -W. Edwards Deming</p>
<p>Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage. Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature -centric batches of work - microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget “devops,” cloud-based services and platforms automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards. But velocity, for velocity’s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. In this talk, we’ll look at how high performance organizations like Ticketmaster, Alibaba, and Netflix make short work of that complexity with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.</p>
<p>In this workshop we'll look at how to build cloud-native Java systems that are elastic, agile, observable and robust.</p>
<h2>Cloud Native Java (5-10 Days)</h2>

In this talk, we’ll look at how high performance organizations like Ticketmaster, Alibaba, and Netflix make short work of that complexity with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.</p>
<p>In this workshop we'll look at how to build cloud-native Java applications. A cloud native application is:</p>
<ul>
<li>elastic</li>
<li>agile</li>
<li>observable</li>
<li>robust</li>
</ul>
<p>A cloud native application is one that is designed to fully exploit a cloud platform both in the application layer - where things decompose into microservices - and at the data layer where NoSQL offers better horizontal scaling and fitness for specific purpose. This is what we mean by <em>elastic</em>.</p>
<p>A cloud native application is one that is <em>agile</em>. It should be easy to write,  change, test, deploy and operate. If the cost of change is prohibitive  then normal people under normal situations won't do it. We must make doing the right thing - that which supports change - the easy thing.</p>
<p>A cloud native system is <em>observable</em>. It must support at-a-glance insight into what is happening in the system and support remediation. It must be instrumented at the application and systems levels to support the effort of crisis-management.</p>
<p>A cloud native application is one that is <em>fault tolerant</em>, or <em>robust</em>. If a service should fail, the system must be able to recover and degrade gracefully.  Instead of trying to build a system that is predicated on the lie that things are highly available, build instead to optimize for time to remediation.</p>
<p>In this workshop we'll cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Basics</em> - we'll look at Spring Boot application development concepts like auto-configuration and embedded web container deployments (Spring Boot)</p>

Can you visualize all the services in the system? We'll look at how to surface information about your services and systems. (Spring Boot Actuator, Micrometer, Graphite, Spring Cloud Sleuth, OpenZipkin, Spring Cloud Hystrix Dashboard)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Testing</em> -  we'll look at the concepts of test-driven development. We'll cover unit testing individual components and mock them out. We'll look at how to test service interfaces.

</li>
<li>
<p><em>Message-driven and integration-centric architectures</em>  -  We'll look at how to build microservices that talk to each other over messaging fabrics like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.
