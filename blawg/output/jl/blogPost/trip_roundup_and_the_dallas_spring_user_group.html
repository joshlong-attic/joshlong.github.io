	<p><em>17 September 2011</em></p>

	<p>
<P> Hey sports fans!  What a crazy few weeks! September started off with a bang as I found myself in sunny Las Vegas for <a href= "http://www.vmworld.com/community/conference/live/">VMWorld 2011</a>. I really enjoyed the time there to connect with my ops- and system-centric brethren. What a great crowd, and the excitement surrounding the exodus to the <a href= "http://www.cloudfoundry.com">cloud</a> was <EM>palatable</em>. People are excited about vFabric, and about connecting their applications  with a truly integrated stack, RabbitMQ, GemFire, tcServer, etc., and they're doubly excited that they have in the Spring portfolion a unified programming model for all of these technologies. So, exciting stuff, definitely. If you missed all the excitement, don't fret: lots of was recorded and made available <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/VMworldTV">here</a>!
 	 </p> <p> The week after that, I found myself en-route for Oslo, Norway, for the 10th annual <a href="http://javazone.no/2011">JavaZone</a> conference, which <EM>rocked</EM>. This was my second time speaking there and I can tell you, in no uncertain terms, that vikings rock! What a great community. This conference seems like the conference for the thinking developer, and featured plenty of content on Spring and Scala this year.  
	</p>
	 <P> I also had the pleasure of taking a tour of the Norwegian fjords with colleague and great guy <a href="http://www.chrisrichardson.net/">Chris Richardson</a>. If I get around to it I'll try to post some incriminating photos later :-) </P>
	<p> 
	The best part? Even if you weren't lucky enough to be there, you can still partake in the fun by watching the recorded videos which JavaZone's generously <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/javazone">put online on Vimeo for free</a>.  There's of course my talk  on <a href="http://vimeo.com/28760638">Spring configuration</a>, Costin Leau's the <a href="http://vimeo.com/28721724">Spring 3.1 caching abstraction</a>, Mark Fisher's talk on <a href="http://vimeo.com/28795501">Spring Integration with CloudFoundry</a> (bonus: the talk, <a href="http://vimeo.com/28606559">"Event Driven Architecture with the Spring framework"</a> from last year is also available!), Costin's other talk on <a  href="http://vimeo.com/28793832">Spring Data</a>, and Chris Richardson's talk on  <a href="http://vimeo.com/28769090">Polyglot Persistence</a>, all available in English. If you speak Norwegian, then there's ample content for you, as well, including a talk on <a href="http://vimeo.com/28764778">Spring Java configuration in Scala</a>, and on performance gains with <a href="http://vimeo.com/28760363">Spring Batch</a>.  I think I saw some others, too, but as I don't speak Norwegian, I can't be too sure! Enjoy! 		
	 </p> 
	
	<p> As if that weren't enough excitement, next week I have the <strong>honor</strong> of speaking at the <A href= "http://www.springdallasug.org/?p=127">Dallas Spring User Group</a>. I'll be giving two related talks, one   on the SPIs exposed to the interested Java developer in   core Spring and,  one on the SPIs exposed in Spring Integration. Both talks are done with an eye towards extending the framework to accomodate advanced use cases. </p><p>Of course, some of it may be old news for the veteran and whip-smart Spring users at that particular group, but we'll see if I can't surprise a few of 'em! ;-) If you're in the Dallas, Texas area and want to talk Spring, come on down or ping me on Twitter at <a  href  ="http://www.twitter.com/starbuxman">@starbuxman</a>.
