I'm in my hotel room thinking about the last 3 days here at <a 
href="http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/">The ServerSide Java 
Symposium.</a> I've had a fantastic time. I gave and/or participated 
in two talks: one was a talk on jBPM and Spring, the other was 
participation (representing <a 
href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-integration">Spring 
Integration</a>) in a panel with Jeff Genender (representing <a 
href="http://servicemix.apache.org/home.html">ServiceMix</a>) and Ross 
Mason (representing <a href="http://www.mulesource.org">Mule</A>) on 
ESBs. I enjoyed that process and enjoyed talking to Jeff and Ross 
gentlemen to the last. The 400+ people in the audience were 
invigorating too. Im pretty sure anybody would tell you this year was 
a welcome, marked improvement over previous years, especially in 
attendance numbers. It also heralded the introduction of a new 
editorial lineup, with Cameron Mckenzie taking the lead-editors 
position. Hes got his work cut out for him, but Im confident hes up to 
the task. 
</p><p> 
Rod Johnson gave a "zepo" (zero-powerpoint) Spring / Roo keynote, 
which was very impressive until it seemed to have failed him at the 
end. A post mortem revealed that the demo was fine, just a simple 
error. It was interesting to note that <a 
href="http://twitter.com/springrod/statuses/10735520971">he 
misplaced</a> his wedding ring and still gave a 99% performance 
without slides in front of 400+ people! Well done! Spring Roo seemed 
to garner a lot of attention from the audience and the Twitterati. 
Matt Raible and James Wards talk on Flex vs. GWT was fun, as expected. 
Jeff Genender and Keath Hesler both turned in good talks on 
ServiceMix. Ted Neward and Scott Davis gave their talks to great 
reception, as usual. Finally, my old friends Reza Rahman, Kito Mann, 
etc., did very well too. I missed some of the JBoss crowd (Emmanuel 
Bernard and Dan Allen, notably) this year, however. 
</p> <p>It was nice meeting James Gosling, too. Can't help but feel a 
little in-awe. 
The final treat was partaking in the festivities, libations, etc., 
with my colleagues at <a 
href="http://tech.shopzilla.com">Shopzilla.</a> Tim Morrow, Senior 
Architect at Shopzilla, gave a very <a 
href="http://twitter.com/springrod/statuses/10736658220">well received 
talk</a> about the scale story at Shopzilla.
