		<h1>Speaking at JavaZone 2011</h1>
	</div>

	<p><em>07 August 2011</em></p>

	<p><p> I'm excited to announce that I'll be speaking at <a href="http://jz11.java.no/">JavaZone</a> again this year. I must confess, I was a little worried that I would not be accepted this year! My talk last year - on business process management and Spring Integration - seemed to garner puzzled looks. Perhaps I just misread the <em>amazing</em> Norwegian audience? The conference (and the technical presentations, to boot) were both wonderful.</p> 
<p> I had the wonderful experience of stopping at a booth and having somebody try to sell me training in Spring (which, I mean, sure... more training's always good!), but the kicker came when he showed me the training manual! It was the book that Gary Mak and Daniel Rubio and I co-authored, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1430224991/ref=asc_df_14302249911656168?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=asn&amp;creative=395093&amp;creativeASIN=1430224991">Spring Recipes!</a></em> </p> 
<p> I submitted on other topics, as well, last year, and those were not accepted. No matter, I gave my talk, and indeed the people that did <em>get</em> it, <em>really</em> got it! So, while I'm not complaining, it still wasn't exactly my best day. I'm thus thrilled to be invited back and - as if fate wasn't already shining on me - my 3-hour university talk's been accepted. My talk's called, "Spring, a Walking Tour," which is a bit of misnomer, as I'm usually the only one walking at all! ;-) I'll be talking about the Spring landscape - <em>everything</em>, from the cloud, mobile, integration, batch processing, big-data, and more! Check it out. This talk was well received when I gave it at Geecon earlier this year, and I've already updated it to reflect a lot of the new stuff in the Spring 3.1 milestones. </p> 
<p>The city of Oslo, as you no doubt have heard, recently experienced <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oIE-WSemIs">a terrorist attack</a> resulting in the massacre of innocents, both adult and children. It broke my heart to see this. What a <b>disgusting</b>, <b>horrible</b> incident, obviously. It's beyond comprehension, no matter where it happens, of course. It was particularly surprising to me that it happened in Oslo, however, as it seemed like such a beautiful, clean, ideal city when I was there. I will take more time, this year, to explore Oslo, and to take in more of Norway's beauty, and to walk among these strong people. I really have a lot of respect for the way the people of the city responded to the incident. They are inspirational. </p> 
<p> I hope you'll join me at JavaZone, and in Oslo, in general, to be inspired. </p></p>
