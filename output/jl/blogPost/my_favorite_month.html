		<h1>My Favorite Month</h1>
	</div>

	<p><em>31 January 2009</em></p>

	<p>
<p>
<img alt ="This is Pancit. I'm vegetarian, so there's no Shrimp or sausage in the variety I eat. But still: yummy!" style = "float:left; margin-right:10px;" width ="300" src="media/17843"/>Today - the 31st of January  - is my birthday. I celebrated it by sharing a wonderful meal of Pancit (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancit ) with my girl last night, and then finally going to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Peters">Russel Peters</a>  last night at the Improv at the invitation of my good friend Venkatesh. That was probably the hardest I've laughed in a month. My brother from another mother Mario took me out drinking last night afterwards, and the fact that I don't remember much of it attests to how well we did!
</p><p>January 31st's also my dad's birthday! Yes, that's right, I was an awkward birthday gift :-) He's 71, now. Astonishing. I'm very surprised that a man's years can so belie a man's youth. I hope everybody gets to be as interesting, and wonderful a man as he is - even once in there lives. I love my dad very much, and owe a large debt of gratitude to him. I wouldn't be the man I am without his unique contributions. I'll be going to Los Angeles next Friday to see him. I can't wait.
</p><p>January in recent years has become more involved because there are two new special occasions to celebrate.
</p><p>My buddy's daughter Makani - a light in dark, boring times - joined the eternal conversation of life on January 26th, 2007. She's one year old now. Long may she live, and smile.  I don't normally like babies. It's not that I dislike them - I just don't know what to do with them. This one's different. She's humbling. She inspires. I can't believe it's been one year, and I can't believe she's come as far as she has. She's been 100 different Makanis over the last year - constantly, and manifestly, evolving and growing. Part of that is biological imperative. Part of that is... something else altogether miraculous.
</p> <p><b>Here's to January</b>.</p>
