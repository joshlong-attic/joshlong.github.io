		<h1>A Bootiful, Reactive April and May 2018 (with apperances from Spring co-founders Rod Johnson and Juergen Hoeller!)</h1>
	</div>

	<p><em>16 August 2018</em></p>

	<p><p>I just concluded a wonderful Devoxx FR where I was reunited with old friends and spoke to people about cloud native (reactive) Spring.</p> 
<p>I did two workshops (one at Devoxx FR, and another for Zenika, as a meetup, in the evening) and then co-presented with Spring co-founder and my hero (and freind) Juergen Hoeller. It was a lot of fun and I want to thank all those that turned up! It was an honor!</p> 
<!-- zenika phto of the folks who remained even after 3h at 10pm  --> 
<p>Now it's off to the states for some business then I return to Europe, Sunday, <a href="https://jax.de/programm/">for JAX in Mainz, Germany</a>. There, I'll co-present <em>again</em> with Juergen. I speak French (so that helped in Paris) and he speaks German (that'll help in Mainz)! It's a nice symmetry. We'll even have a bit more time to articulate our ideas - an hour! I'll also be doing a <em>Cloud Native Java</em> book signing at JAX, so don't miss that!</p> 
<p>They announced that JavaDays Ukraine would soon join the Devoxx franchise and family as Devoxx Ukraine and Juergen and I have already been invited to speak there. I sure hope we can! Congratulations to the team. It looks like it's going to be an exciting adventure.</p> 
<p>Then, it's off to Linz, Austria (where Juergen lives, no less), <a href="https://devone.at/">for the DevOne show</a>. There, again, Juergen and I will co-present on all things Reactive Spring. If you're there, don't miss this opportunity to meet Juergen Hoeller, one of the greats!</p> 
<p>On the 27th, I'll be presenting at a meetup <a href="https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Enterprise-Java-User-Group-Austria/events/249259945/">in Vienna, Austria</a>.</p> 
<p>Then, on 2-3 May I'll be in Melbourne, Australia, and the <a href="https://voxxeddays.com/melbourne/">VOXXED Melbourne event</a>. This is exciting! I'll be co-presenting with the <em>other</em> Spring co-founder, Rod Johnson, in his native Australia! Do <em>not</em> miss this!</p> 
<p>Then, it's off to Manchester, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ManchesterUK-Java-Community/events/248184150/">UK for a meetup on the 9th of May, 2018</a>. Do you want to miss this? I think not!</p> 
<p>From there, I'll head to <a href="https://www.devoxx.co.uk/">Devoxx UK</a>, one of my all time favorite shows, in London on the 9th to 11th May. I'll also be speaking to customers there.</p> 
<p>Then, it's off to Denver, Colorado for the <a href="https://springonetour.io/2018/denver">epic SpringOne Tour Denver event</a> on the 14th. These SpringOne Tour events sell out quick, so don't miss this one!</p> 
<p>From Denver, I head off to Kyiv, Ukraine for a <a href="http://jug.ua/">JUG meeting</a>. I'll also be presenting at the <a href="https://jeeconf.com/">JEEConf</a> event on the 18th of May. Juergen and I will again be co-presenting there!</p> 
<p>I'll be in Dublin an Belfast speaking to customers and <em>hopefully</em> doing a JUG on the 21st of May.</p> 
<p>Then, from there, it's off to the legendary <a href="https://2018.springio.net/">Spring I/O</a> event in beautful (<em>bootiful</em>) Bercelona, Spain! Join us!</p> 
<p>Then, finally, I'll return home to San Francisco for a few days in the sun before I make the trek to Singapore for the epic <a href="https://voxxeddays.com/singapore/">VOXXED Singapore event</a>.</p> 
<p>Needless to say, if you're in any of the regions in which I'm speaking I'd love to see you there and hear from you!</p></p>
