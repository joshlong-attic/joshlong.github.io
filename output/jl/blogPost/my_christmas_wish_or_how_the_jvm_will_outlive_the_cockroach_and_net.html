		<h1>My Christmas Wish, OR How the JVM Will Outlive the  Cockroach, and .NET</h1>
	</div>

	<p><em>29 August 2009</em></p>

	<p>
<p> It started with a Tweet from <a 
href="http://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/status/3627322220">Miguel De 
Icaza</a>. Miguel's the leader of the Mono project, whose goal's to 
bring .NET to Linux. He's also the former leader of the Gnome project. 
Generally, he's whip smart and not usually prone to flame baits. So, I 
tend to read his words carefully, as it usually pays off. He said: 
<cite>"I wish Java tried to compete with .NET, but they seemed to have 
given up a long time ago: <a 
href="http://tinyurl.com/mfxmqm">http://tinyurl.com/mfxmqm</a>"</cite> 
</p> <p>At this point I wanted to write him a terse letter stating 
my point of view, stating how he had clearly missed the obvious. I 
resisted,  cried a little, sat on the beach with 
candles, attended a book club meeting, found Jesus, and then came back 
and reconciled that I was just sad because he was right. He was also 
pointing out the obvious. (There, at least I can say that! <span style 
= "font-size:smaller">in the anonymity of my blog, <span style = 
"font-size:smaller;">far, far away from where he might see 
it...</span></span>) </p><p> The link points to integrations in <a 
href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/coin/">Project Coin,</a> a 
project that's taken the JDK and aggressivey evolved the language 
to try certain features out in an isolated fork. In general, I'm 
supportive of the movement, but it's a sad truth that any final 
edition of JDK 7 is already late, and will likely not incorporate many 
of those integrations in Project Coin, or even many of the originally 
announced - big ticket changes coming straight from Sun. JDK7 is the 
Windows Vista/<i>Longhorn</i> of the JDKs.</p><p> You remember 
Longhorn, right? It was the code name for Windows Vista for a few 
years. If I recall, there was talk of integrating 4 pillars or waves 
of technology into the then-hyped next generation of Windows, 
including <i>WinFS</i> (Am I wrong in thinking that it was called 
something else, then? Avalon? Or am I thinking of the now-defunct Java 
DI container?) <i>Indigo</i>, and a slew of others. As the roadmap 
slipped further and further, more things were dropped. In fairness, in 
2009, some of those pillars have subsequently shipped, sort of, as 
parts of .NET 3.0-3.5x. Some are lost to the annals of history. </p> 
<p>With a heavy heart I proceeded to code, ignoring what he said. I'm 
tougher than that. I can handle having the rug yanked out from under 
me. "Why would he say that about my precious Java??" I thought, typing 
as I thought it. "I wish I could come up with something to refute his 
claims!", I moaned. Something elegant, quick, crazy fast, and future 
proof. Something's got the best of C#, F#, Python, JavaScript and 
more. I tend to ignore skills I've built up over years of use and 
revert to primitive, conveniently blog-friendly samples from tutorials 
when I'm stressed (don't you?). And <i>boy</i> was I stressed! I 
looked at my screen. I was really in a tizzy at this point, 
thrashing away at the keyboard! (Like in those movies where they 
feature somebody running their hands along the home row and suddenly 
they've infiltrated the FBI's secret-most files.) </p><p>Here's what I 
had typed: </p><pre><code>object Maps { 
 val colors = Map("red" -> 0xFF0000, 
 "turquoise" -> 0x00FFFF, 
 "black" -> 0x000000, 
 "orange" -> 0xFF8040, 
 "brown" -> 0x804000) 
 def main(args: Array[String]) { 
 for (name <- args) println( 
 colors.get(name) match { 
 case Some(code) => 
 name + " has code: " + code 
 case None => 
 "Unknown color: " + name 
 } 
 ) 
 } 
} 
</code></pre><p> It was a Christmas miracle! A language on the JVM 
that already had most of the proposed changes in Project Coin and 
great deal otherwise <i>and</i> was very fast <i>and</i> that worked 
on all platforms, <strike>just like Mono!</strike> Errr... that is, 
just like Java! </p> <p>This language, <a 
href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala,</a> has gained a great deal 
of traction in the Java community and even people you'd expect to 
offer otherwise have endorsed it. People like James Strachan, creator 
of Groovy, and James Gosling, creator of Java. </p> <p>I just hope 
that other people can find out about this wonderful language. Why, 
wouldn't it be nice if -for Java 8 (will we ever get to have a Java X? 
How cool would that be??) - we just shipped Scala? </p> 
<p>And that, boys and girls, is how Java outlived the cockroach, in 
our hearts.</p> <P><i>The End!</i></p>
