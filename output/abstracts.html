	<p><p>All talks are workable in a one-hour slot unless otherwise noted.</p>
<h2>Cloud Native Java</h2>
<p>“It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory.” -W. Edwards Deming</p>
<p>Work takes time to flow through an organization and ultimately be deployed to production where it captures value. It’s critical to reduce time-to-production. Software - for many organizations and industries - is a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Organizations break their larger software ambitions into smaller, independently deployable, feature -centric batches of work - microservices. In order to reduce the round-trip between stations of work, organizations collapse or consolidate as much of them as possible and automate the rest; developers and operations beget “devops,” cloud-based services and platforms (like Cloud Foundry) automate operations work and break down the need for ITIL tickets and change management boards.</p>
<p>But velocity, for velocity’s sake, is dangerous. Microservices invite architectural complexity that few are prepared to address. In this talk, we’ll look at how high performance organizations like Ticketmaster, Alibaba, and Netflix make short work of that complexity with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.</p>
<h2>The Bootiful Application</h2>
<p>Alright, so maybe "bootiful" won't ever work, but I tried, and it was worth it too because you're reading this. Spring Boot, the new convention-over-configuration centric framework from the Spring team at Pivotal, marries Spring's flexibility with conventional, common sense defaults to make application development not just fly, but pleasant! Spring Boot aims to make address the common functional and non-functional requirements that gate quickly moving to production.</p>
<p>Join Spring developer advocate Josh Long for a look at what Spring Boot is, why it's turning heads, why you should consider it for your next application (REST, micro services, web, batch, big data, integration, whatever!) and how to get started.</p>
<h2>The Bootiful Microservice</h2>
<p>We get it already! Microservices help you build smaller, singly-focused services, quicker. They scale out. They’re more agile because individual teams can deliver them at their own pace. They work well in the cloud because they’re smaller, and benefit from elastic, horizontal scaling. But what about the complexity? There’s a cost associated with adding services and coordinating the interactions between them. In this talk, we’ll look at Spring Cloud, which builds atop Spring Boot and the Netflix OSS stack, and see how it lets you easily integrate service-discovery, security, reliability patterns like the circuit breaker, and centralized and journaled property configuration (and more) to more quickly build microservices that scale.</p>
<p>Join Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long to find out what Netflix, Alibaba, Ticketmaster, and countless other organizations already know: Spring Cloud handles the non-functional requirements associated with adopting microservices to enable them to progress quickly.</p>
<h2>The Operationalized Application</h2>
<p>We all talk about agile, but being agile means being shippable, and shippable specifically to production! Anyone who has ever read Michael Nygard's amazing tome, "Release It!" knows that code complete != production ready! In this talk we'll look at how Spring Boot provides solutions for things that will frustrate your attempts to move to production. We'll look at how to introduce smart, semantic metrics and logging, how to manage metric and log analysis and visualization in joined-up dashboards, how to manage processes in environments with init.d and system.d, and how to make services self describing and humane once they're deployed.</p>
<h2>Reactive Spring</h2>
<p>Spring 5 is almost here! One of the most exciting introductions in this release is support for reactive programming, building on the Pivotal Reactor project to support message-driven, elastic, resilient and responsive services. Spring 5 integrates an MVC-like component model adapted to support reactive processing and a new type of web endpoint, functional reactive endpoints. In this talk, we'll look at the net-new Netty-based web runtime, how existing Servlet code can run on the new world, and how to integrate it with existing Spring-stack technologies.</p>
<h2>Bootiful Testing (1-3h)</h2>
<p>How would you feel if you knew that any pat of the code was at most a few minutes away from being shippable and delivered into production? How would you feel if you knew that any part of the code is a few ctrl+z's away from being shippable and delivered into production? Emboldened and confident? Test driven development (TDD) gives you that. TDD allows you to proceed with confidence that you're building the right thing. It provides you with imminent-horizons that you can meet and measure. TDD gives developers the confidence to go faster, secure in the knowledge that what they break they will fix and be able to improve. In this talk, join Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman) as he looks at how to test Spring applications and services. We'll look at how to test basic components, mocks, how to take advantage of test slices, and how to test web applications. We'll also look at how to ensure that API producers and API consumers work well together using consumer driven contract testing (CDCT) without sacrificing the testing pyramid for end-to-end integration tests.</p>
<h2>Bootiful Reactive Microservices</h2>
<p>When you move to microservices you invite the complexity of distribution into your architecture. Thankfully, we can stand on the shoulders of giants and use frameworks like Spring Boot and Spring Cloud to address this complexity. In this talk, we're going to revisit these technologies in the light of the newly integrated support for reactive programming, starting from Spring Framework 5, Spring Boot 2.0, and Spring Cloud Finchley.</p>
<h2>Cloud Native Java (3-6h)</h2>

<p>In this workshop we'll look at how to build cloud-native Java systems that are elastic, agile, observable and robust.</p>

<p>In this workshop we'll look at how to build cloud-native Java applications. A cloud native application is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>elastic</li>
  <li>agile</li>
  <li>observable</li>
  <li>robust</li>
</ul>
<p>A cloud native application is one that is designed to fully exploit a cloud platform both in the application layer - where things decompose into microservices - and at the data layer where NoSQL offers better horizontal scaling and fitness for specific purpose. This is what we mean by <em>elastic</em>.</p>
<p>A cloud native application is one that is <em>agile</em>. It should be easy to write, change, test, deploy and operate. If the cost of change is prohibitive then normal people under normal situations won't do it. We must make doing the right thing - that which supports change - the easy thing.</p>
<p>A cloud native system is <em>observable</em>. It must support at-a-glance insight into what is happening in the system and support remediation. It must be instrumented at the application and systems levels to support the effort of crisis-management.</p>
<p>A cloud native application is one that is <em>fault tolerant</em>, or <em>robust</em>. If a service should fail, the system must be able to recover and degrade gracefully. Instead of trying to build a system that is predicated on the lie that things are highly available, build instead to optimize for time to remediation.</p>
<p>In this workshop we'll cover:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p><em>Basics</em> - we'll look at Spring Boot application development concepts like auto-configuration and embedded web container deployments (Spring Boot)</p></li>
  <li>
  <p><em>REST APIs</em> - we'll look at concerns like API versioning and hypermedia. (Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Spring HATEOAS)</p></li>

  <p><em>Data Access</em> - we'll model a service domain and define bounded contexts. (Spring Boot, Spring Data)</p></li>
  <li>
  <p><em>Observability</em> - what happens when there's a problem with your production application? How quickly can your team respond? How do you know if you're making improvements to a system? How do you measure progress? How do you monitor individual applications? How do you monitor the flow of requests through circuit breakers? How do you trace requests across the system? Can you visualize all the services in the system? We'll look at how to surface information about your services and systems. (Spring Boot Actuator, Micrometer, Graphite, Spring Cloud Sleuth, OpenZipkin, Spring Cloud Hystrix Dashboard)</p></li>
  <li>
  <p><em>Testing</em> - we'll look at the concepts of test-driven development. We'll cover unit testing individual components and mock them out. We'll look at how to test service interfaces.

(JUnit, Spring Boot, Spring MVC Test Framework, Spring Cloud Contract)</p></li>
  <li>
  <p><em>Routing and Load-Balancing</em> - where does your service live? How do your clients find it? How do you handle custom routing requirements? How do you handle custom load-balancing? (Spring Cloud, Ribbon)</p></li>
  <li>
  <p><em>Message-driven and integration-centric architectures</em> - We'll look at how to build microservices that talk to each other over messaging fabrics like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ. We'll look at how to integrate existing systems and how to use messaging to connect disparate systems. (RabbitMQ, Spring Integration, Spring Cloud Stream)</p></li>
  <li>
  <p><em>Stream Processing</em> - We'll look at how to build solutions that process ongoing data over time. We'll look at how to compose messaging-based microservices and orchestrate them over a cloud-based fabric. (Spring Cloud Stream, Spring Cloud Data Flow)</p></li>
