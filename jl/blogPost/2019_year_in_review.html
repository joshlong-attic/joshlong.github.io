		<h1>Josh&apos;s 2019 in Review</h1>
	</div>

	<p><em>31 December 2019</em></p>

	<p><p>You know I've always wanted to do these Year In Review blogs, but I'm usually so darned busy I always forget. So, finally, I get to do it. Let's see. What was 2019 for me?</p>
<p>I don't even know where to start. It's tempting to boil it down to numbers. Let's see if that works. According to UNITED, alone, not including any other non-Star Alliance airline, I traveled 636,000 &quot;premier qualifying miles,&quot; I spent $156,316 on flights, and I flew 187 segments this year. The &quot;premier qualifying miles&quot; have multipliers that mean they're not always the same as actual miles flown. Tripit does a pretty good job of tracking actual miles. It shows that in 2019 I flew 445,000 miles this year. I spoke to a <em>ton</em> of customers and at a <em>ton</em> of conferences. I did every city on the SpringOne Platform tour. I made a ton of other appearances. I went (twice!) to every continent this year, save Antarctica, where I've not yet set foot. In all, I gave north of 280 different talks, online, in-person, at conferences, or for customers, all around the world.</p>
<p>I released a new episode of my podcast, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/a-bootiful-podcast"><em>A Bootiful Podcast</em></a>, every week of 2019. I published a few dozen new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTKlk8_9aAw&amp;list=PLgGXSWYM2FpPw8rV0tZoMiJYSCiLhPnOc">Spring Tips videos</a>. I blogged <em>at least</em> twice a week, every week, all year. I always release <em>This Week in Spring</em>, on the <a href="http://spring.io/blog">Spring blog</a>, and I consistently blog about the latest podcast episode. Some weeks I also blogged about the newest Spring Tips video. Some weeks I <em>also</em> published one or two installments in a series. I did a few series this year on reactive programming, on Spring Cloud for Microsoft Azure, on Spring Cloud for Google Cloud Platform, etc. So, some weeks I did as many as four or five blogs a week. But at <em>least</em> once a week.</p>
<p>In January, I visited Montreal, Canada; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
<p>In February, I visited Saint Louis, Missouri; Denver, Colorado; Washington DC, USA; Kansas City, Kansas; and Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>In March, I visited Tel Aviv, Israel; Atlanta, Georgia; Seattle, Washington; Montreal, Canada; London, UK; Amsterdam, Netherlands; and Pleasanton, California;</p>
<p>In April, I visited New York City, New York; Cape Town, South Africa; Johannesburg, South Africa; Mauritius; Cape Town, South Africa; Belgrade, Serbia; Shanghai, China; Hangzhou, China; Los Angeles, California; Warsaw, Poland; Istanbul, Turkey; Chicago, Illinois; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>In May, I visited Chicago, Illinois; San Francisco, California; Sao Paolo, Brazil; London, UK; Krakow, Poland; Barcelona, Spain; Zurich Switzerland; Paris, France; Minsk, Belarus; and Barcelona, Spain.</p>
<p>In June, I visited San Francisco, California; Cork, Ireland; London, UK; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Atlanta, Georgia; Des Moines, Iowa; Minneapolis, Minnesota, Tampa, Florida; Paris, France; and the Dominican Republic;</p>
<p>In July, I visited Medellin, Columbia; Chicago, Illinois; Lima, Peru; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Portland, Oregon; Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; Burlington, Massachusetts; and San Mateo, California.</p>
<p>In August, I visited Sebastapol, California; and Austin, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Dallas, Texas; San Diego, California; Denver, Colorado; and Bangalore, India.</p>
<p>In September, I visited Oslo, Norway; San Francisco, California; Banff, Canada; Victoria, Canada; Madrid, Spain; and Guadalajara, Mexico.</p>
<p>In October, I visited Taipei, Taiwan; Austin, Texas; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Prague, Czech Republic; Nantes, France; Bologne-Billancourt, France; St. Petersburg, Russia; Chicago, Illinois; and San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>In November, I visited Kyiv, Ukraine; Antwerp, Belgium; Sydney, Australia; Singapore; Seoul, South Korea; and Tokyo, Japan.</p>
<p>In December, I visited Sydney, Australia; Brisbane, Australia; Tokyo, Japan; Los Angeles, California; and San Francisco, California.</p>
<p>The numbers don't tell the whole story, though. In November, my father entered the hospital. I canceled a ton of trips from mid-November onward so I could be by his bedside. He passed away on 11 December 2019, at 5:45 PM PST. I recorded an <a href="https://soundcloud.com/a-bootiful-podcast/i-need-to-talk-about-my-father-clark-bud-long-who-just-passed-away">episode of the podcast about him</a>. It still hurts to think he's gone. Rest in peace, dad.</p>
<p>I wrote another 150 pages or so (I know, I know, I need to pick up the pace!) on my <a href="http://www.reactivespring.io/"><em>Reactive Spring</em> book</a>, which is available for pre-order now. If you buy it now, you can start reading it now. As I update it, you'll get the updates <em>and</em> you'll also get the final edition once it's published. The book's starting to take final shape and I'm excited to see it finished.</p>
<p>I am also planning on expanding   some of the series I've written in the last 12 months and turning them into new books. Hopefully those will get done in 2020, too. But I will only begin that effort, or those efforts, <strong>after</strong> finishing <em>Reactive Spring</em>.</p>
<p>I also contributed edits and reviews to a few other books, notably, Dr. Venkat Subramaniam's <em>excellent</em> <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/vskotlin/programming-kotlin">Programming Kotlin</a>. It's excellent, <em>despite</em> me. You should absolutely buy it now. I bought my own copy, it's that good.</p>
<p>I was also the  subject of a chapter in Geertjan Wielenga's <em>excellent</em> new book, <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/business-other/developer-advocate"><em>Developer, Advocate!</em></a> book on the work of developer advocacy.</p>
<p>On a personal note, this was the first full year with Kimly, who we helped immigrate to the United States in November 2018. I spent more time in San Francisco than ever in order to be home  as often as possible for that silly little girl. I took the girls - my partner Tammie and our kid Kimly - with me all around the planet in 2019. We went to half a dozen cities in the US together, to Jamaica, to Peru, to various countries in Europe and Asia and even other cities in California. I try to line these trips up with business visits, but I took a few that were just for thrill of being with my amazing family. I'm with them right now, as I write this roundup, in Denver, Colorado, where we're visiting friends and ringing in the new year in the company of friends.</p>
<p>Happy New Year, my friends! May your 2020 find you healthy and happy.</p>
